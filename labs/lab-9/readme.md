## Lab objective
In this lab we will learn about IAM Access Analyzer and how it detects resources that are public or vulnerable. 


## Instructions
1. Deploy the Cloudformation stack "lab-9.yml".
2. Download "lab-9.yml" and familiarize with the stack content. Are there any obvious vulnerabilities?
3. Go to AWS console - CloudFormation and deploy the stack
4. Once the stack has finished deploying, go to IAM - Access Analyzer and review the findings. 
5. Try remediating the vulnerable resources and see if the alert disappears.
